## Prerequisites

You must have an API key and email for Jira.  Export the following environment variables:

| Name | Notes |
|---|---|
| JIRA_TOKEN | Your API token to access our Jira server.  You can generate a token in the [Security](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security) page of your Jira account settings. |
| JIRA_EMAIL | The email address of your account to access Jira. |

You must also download the `Bare Metal Servers` and the `Bare Metal Server Nodes` CSV files from the [Operations Dashboard](https://opsdashboard.w3.cloud.ibm.com/ops/baremetalservers) and place them in a directory named `output`.  The script will automatically look for the ones named with the current date.

Make sure to select the `Include account details` checkbox when exporting the Bare Metal servers.

## Running the report

The report is run with a single command:

```
python3 scripts/generate_zyphra_usage.py
```

There are no arguments needed.  The command will combine the data from the CSV files and from Jira to generate the report shown above.

## Understanding the report

This report tries to give a view of the cluster in a useful way for cluster management.  It shows servers in the following states:

| State | Notes |
|---|---|
| In Use | The count of servers that are in use in the Zyphra cluster right now.  This will count the 2 hot spares as well.  This number should be 128 when everything is healthy. | 
| Zyphra Stopped | The servers that are stopped in the Zyphra account.  This should include the two host spares as well as any servers that they have stopped for other reasons. |
| Available | The servers that are available in the spare pool.  These servers have been deleted from an account.  This number should be at least 4 which makes 6 servers available (including the 2 hot spares) | 
| Stopped | Servers that are stopped and not in the Zyphra account. | 
| Qualifying | Servers that have been returned from a hardware repair and are being qualified as good by IBM before they go into the available pool.  This is the count of all running servers that aren't used by Zyphra.  | 
| Fixing | A server that's currently getting fixed by the hardware repair team or Dell.  These are all servers running that are not in the Zyphra account which have a Jira ticket in the `SMC Support` state. |
| Maintenance | Servers that are in `Maintenance` mode.  This normally means the server is being diagnosed or repaired.  To move a server out of `Maintenance` mode you must do an ECR or an INC following the [Exiting Maintenance Mode](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cloudlab/internal-docs/bare_metal_server_maintenance_mode.html#exiting-maintenance-mode) run book. | 
| Tainted | Servers that are tainted.  This typically means there was an issue during the reclaim process and these servers need additional investigation or repair.  Once a server repair is completed we must create an INC or ECR to follow the [Re-running the reclaim](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cloudlab/internal-docs/bare_metal_server_reclaim_failed.html#re-running-the-reclaim) run book.  [INC9633275](https://watson.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/incident.do%3Fsysparm_query%3Dnumber%3DINC9633275) is an example. | 
| Other | Servers in all other states.  They will show up in a special table to show more of the details server. |
